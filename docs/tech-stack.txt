**Incorporating Storybook**

**1. Installation and Setup:**

*   **Install Storybook:**

    ```bash
    npx storybook@latest init
    ```

    This command will:
    *   Detect that you are using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
    *   Install the necessary Storybook dependencies.
    *   Create a `stories/` directory with example stories.
    *   Add Storybook scripts to your `package.json`.
    *   Set up basic Storybook configuration in a `.storybook` folder.

*   **Update your `package.json`:**
    *   Make sure these scripts are in your package.json. If not, add them.

    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "storybook": "storybook dev -p 6006",
      "build-storybook": "storybook build"
    }
    ```

**2. Configure Storybook for Tailwind CSS:**

*   **Install `postcss-loader`:**

    ```bash
    yarn add -D postcss-loader
    ```

*   **Update `.storybook/main.ts`:**

    ```typescript
    // .storybook/main.ts

    import type { StorybookConfig } from "@storybook/nextjs";
    const config: StorybookConfig = {
      stories: ["../stories/**/*.mdx", "../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)"],
      addons: [
        "@storybook/addon-links",
        "@storybook/addon-essentials",
        "@storybook/addon-interactions",
        "@storybook/addon-styling"
      ],
      framework: {
        name: "@storybook/nextjs",
        options: {},
      },
      docs: {
        autodocs: "tag",
      },
    };
    export default config;
    ```

**3. Write Stories for Your Components:**

*   Create story files (e.g., `Button.stories.tsx`) inside your component folders or in a separate `stories/` directory at the root of the project. I recommend keeping them close to your component. Example: `components/ui/Button/Button.stories.tsx`.
*   Here's an example of how to write a story for the `Button` component:

```tsx
// components/ui/Button/Button.stories.tsx

import type { Meta, StoryObj } from '@storybook/react';

import { Button } from '.';

const meta: Meta<typeof Button> = {
  title: 'ui/Button',
  component: Button,
  parameters: {
    layout: 'centered',
  },
  tags: ['autodocs'],
};

export default meta;

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Button>;

export const Primary: Story = {
  args: {
    children: 'Primary Button',
  },
};

export const Secondary: Story = {
  args: {
    children: 'Secondary Button',
    className: 'border-2 border-gray-500 text-gray-700',
  },
};

export const WithIcon: Story = {
  args: {
    children: 'Button with Icon',
    icon: 'path/to/your/icon.svg',
  },
};
```

**4. Run Storybook:**

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This will start the Storybook development server, typically on port 6006. You can then access Storybook in your browser at `http://localhost:6006/`.

**Tech Stack with Storybook**

Here's a list of the tech you'll need for your T3 Stack project with Storybook, based on what we've discussed:

**Core T3 Stack:**

*   **Next.js:** (with App Router) - Framework for building the application.
*   **TypeScript:**  For type safety.
*   **tRPC:** For type-safe API communication between frontend and backend.
*   **Prisma:** ORM for database interactions.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

**Additional Dependencies:**

*   **Storybook:** UI component development and documentation tool.
*   **`@storybook/addon-essentials`:**  Collection of essential Storybook addons (includes Actions, Controls, Viewport, Backgrounds, etc.).
*   **`@storybook/addon-styling`:** Adds support for Tailwind CSS, PostCSS, and CSS Modules
*   **`@storybook/addon-links`:** For linking between stories.
*   **`@storybook/addon-interactions`:**  For simulating user interactions and debugging.
*   **`@storybook/nextjs`:** Storybook's framework for integrating with Nextjs
*   **`@storybook/react`:** Storybook's React renderer.
*   **`postcss-loader`:** To process your CSS files and resolve things like `@import` and `url()`.
*   **`@types/react`** & **`@types/node`** (if using typescript)
*   **`shpjs`:** (Or another suitable library) For parsing shapefiles (if needed).
*   **`geojson-utils`:** (Or another suitable library) For working with GeoJSON data (if needed).
*   **Database Driver:** `pg` for PostgreSQL -  The driver for your chosen database.
*   **NextAuth.js:** For authentication.

**Optional but Recommended:**

*   **Testing Library:** For component testing (e.g., `React Testing Library`, `Jest`, `Vitest`).
*   **Storybook Addons:** Explore other Storybook addons that might be helpful for your project, such as:
    *   **`@storybook/addon-a11y`:** For accessibility testing.
    *   **`@storybook/addon-docs`:** For generating documentation from your stories.
    *   **`@storybook/addon-viewport`:** For testing responsive layouts.

**Development Workflow:**

1.  **Develop Components in Isolation:** Create and style your reusable components in Storybook. Use stories to define different states and variations.
2.  **Import into Next.js Pages:** Use your components in your Next.js pages (`app/` or `pages/`).
3.  **Implement API Routes:** Create tRPC procedures in `server/api/routers/` to handle data fetching and processing.
4.  **Connect Frontend to Backend:** Use the tRPC client to call your API procedures from your frontend components.
5.  **Test:** Write unit tests for your components and API routes.
6.  **Document:** Use Storybook to create documentation for your components and their usage.

This comprehensive directory structure, along with the outlined technologies and workflow, will set you up for success in building a well-structured, maintainable, and scalable Next.js application using the T3 Stack and Storybook. Remember to tailor it to your specific project needs and preferences.
